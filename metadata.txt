about= To run the SLEUTH urban growth model in separate subregions, separate folders with layers in apropiate format and with apropiate naming convention are needed, and that is exactly what this plugin does. Additionally it stores an extent.json file for each subregion, containing data needed to convert gif outputs from SLEUTH to proper tiff rasters.
