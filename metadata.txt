description=This plugin helps to create folders containing input layers to run SLEUTH urban growth model.
version=3.0
author=Fidel Serrano-Candela, Rodrigo Garcia-Herrera
email=serranoycandela@gmail.com

about=This plugin helps to create folders containing input layers to run SLEUTH urban growth model. For this version general rasters in tif format and a shape file with subregions are needed. A field named “location” in the subregions shape file with intended names for subregions is needed, this will change in future versions, to make it even easier for the user. While processing, it will create extent.json files for each subregion containing needed data to transform gif outputs from SLEUTH to proper tif rasters.
